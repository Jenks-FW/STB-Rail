# STB-Rail
* All scripts related to Surface Transportation Board Freight Commodity Statistics for 7 major North American Rail companies
* STB rail data acquired from the [STB website](https://prod.stb.gov/reports-data/economic-data/freight-commodity-statistics/)
* Files with 'Cleanup' in the name were used to prepare old rail data by company
* The 'STB-Scratch' is random snippets of code from troubleshooting functions and trying different approaches. It's a dumpster fire of failed code and nonsense notes
* The 'STB-Rail-Update' is a WIP that will automate cleaning and importing new rail data to SQL when it is complete.
